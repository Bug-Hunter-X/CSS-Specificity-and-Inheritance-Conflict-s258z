The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue where specificity and inheritance interact unexpectedly:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

.specific-p {
  color: green;
}

#myDiv p {
  color: purple; /* This rule is unexpectedly overridden */
}

#myDiv .specific-p {
  color: orange; /* This is fine, it's the most specific */
}

<div id="myDiv">
  <p class="specific-p">This text should be orange.</p>
  <p>This text should be purple.</p>
</div>
```

The expectation is that `#myDiv p` would style the first paragraph purple. However, the paragraph's `color:red` declaration inherited from the `p` selector and its higher specificity overrides the `#myDiv p` rule.
