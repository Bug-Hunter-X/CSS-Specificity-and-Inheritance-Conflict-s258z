The solution involves using the `!important` flag to ensure that the intended style is applied despite the inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

.specific-p {
  color: green;
}

#myDiv p {
  color: purple !important; /* Now this rule works as expected */
}

#myDiv .specific-p {
  color: orange; /* This is fine, it's the most specific */
}
```

Alternatively, restructuring the CSS or using more specific selectors can eliminate the need for `!important` but may require larger changes to the CSS file.
